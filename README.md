# pinguin
Official repository of Pinguin (Discord BOT), an OPEN SOURCE project (DISCORD BOT), which is developed using JavaScript (ES6) and fully customizable.

> This goal of this project is to create a DISCORD BOT with a built-in chatbot (OpenAI) and image generator (Replicate). Something perfect to bring a happy atmosphere to your server, and generate some epic images, something like a pixelated penguin?

## Usage
### Requirements
```
NodeJS Version: v16.14.x or higher
DiscordJS Version: V14.x
NPM Version: v7.x or higher
```

### Initialization
To initialize, you need to open a terminal for the project, and enter the following commands:
```
npm install
npm run init
```
They will ask you for the necessary data to start the bot.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should never share that data.

### Start running the bot
Now that you have everything configured, you can turn on the bot! To do this, use this command in the same console as before.
```
npm start
```
If everything goes well, you should see some green messages, that means you can now enjoy the bot!

But if you see red error messages, it is possible that something bad has happened, check the error and report it in [Issues](https://github.com/HardXploitDev/pinguin/issues). Or if you want, you can join the [official support server](https://discord.gg/R4gGXCD6bc) (Discord).
